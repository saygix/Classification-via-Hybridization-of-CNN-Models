# Classification via Hybridization of CNN Models

In this study, it investigates the hybridization of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
models and evaluate the image classification performance of this approach. The basic
principles and working mechanisms of CNN models are explained, and different methods
and strategies for hybridization are discussed.

The study presents a new method for hybridizing CNN models and this method is evaluated
by experimental studies. The results show that hybridization of CNN models outperforms
results when used alone. The developed hybrid model provides higher classification
accuracy and lower error rates.

This study contributes to research in the field of hybridizing CNN models and presents a
new method to the deep learning community. It points to the potential of hybridization to
improve the performance of deep learning models.
